It\r\nis inspired by traditional text adventure games from years ago, with some\r\nnew ideas and features.\r\n\r\nThis project comes with a server and client. See the `USAGE.md` file for\r\nmore information about how to use them.\r\n\r\nSince `Dungeon` is a game *engine*, you can write your own universe files\r\nand start the `Dungeon` server with them. See the `yaml` directory for\r\nthe configuration file (to tell the server which universe file to\r\nload) and the default \"demo\" universe file that I've written.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
