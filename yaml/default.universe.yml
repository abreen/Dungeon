# Default Dungeon universe file
# The following universe file is included with all installations of
# Dungeon. Feel free to experiment with it. The document format is YAML.
# This universe was written by Alexander Breen (alexander.breen@gmail.com).
# Your use of it coincides with an acknowledgement that you will not hold
# me responsible if something terrible happens.

# Every Dungeon universe file consists of three YAML documents: the first is
# a preamble, containing settings for the entire universe. The second is the
# list of rooms in the universe. The third is the list of items.
# Each object in the universe has a unique string ID that you may choose here.

weather:    true        # Whether to generate weather in the universe
spawn:      henge       # The string ID of the room in which players start
timescale:  3           # Multiplier used to determine the game tick speed

--- # rooms

henge:
  name:         henge   # The name of the room, used when describing it
  isOutside:    true    # Whether to print weather (not yet implemented)

    You are in the center of a large henge, perhaps as wide as fifty meters in
    diameter, with a circle of huge, rectangular, stone monoliths standing
    proudly around you. The stones have the worn, rounded appearance of century-old
    building material. From what you can see, the henge is perched atop a rocky
    cliff, whose northern edge overlooks some water. To the south there is
    a forest. The air is surprisingly still inside the henge.
  exits:

forest_edge:
  name:         forest edge
  isOutside:    true
  description:  >
    The cliff slopes into a smooth hill, covered with healthy grasses. A few
    meters in front of you there stands a tree with a giant, dark trunk.
    The lowest branches of the tree are moving slightly in the wind, almost
    as if the tree were taking breaths. Hundreds (thousands?) of trees span
    your vision to the south.

dense_wood:
  name:             dense wood
  neverUseArticle:  true
  isOutside:        true
  description:      >
    Tall trees with dark trunks surround you. At every gust of slight wind,
    their ancient, knotted branches sigh and squeak quietly. To the north, you
    can see sky through gaps in the trunks.
  exits:
    north: forest_edge
    south: deep_wood
    west: butterfly_tree

butterfly_tree:
  name:         butterfly tree
  isOutside:    true
  description:  >
    The trees seem to have grown shorter here, or at least their lowest branches
    are low enough to prevent you from walking through. An ancient tree stands
    ahead of you, from which no leaves are growing but instead moss. There are
    an unusual number of blue butterflies in this area. Maybe they've come here
    to mate.

  name:             more dense wood
  neverUseArticle:  true
  isOutside:        true
  description:      >
    You are surrounded by dark trunks. The trees have grown so densely that you
    cannot see more than a few meters before your eyes meet gnarled bark.
  exits:
    north: dense_wood
    south: forest_clearing

forest_clearing:
  name:         clearing
  isOutside:    true
  description:  >
    You are standing in a circular clearing, where the trees have ceased growing
    suddenly, and the ground is pale and covered with light dirt. There are a
    couple of small rocks in a near-circle near the center. It could have been a
    campfire, but it seems to be decades old. There's a delicate nest in a tree
    nearby.

  name:         cave entrance
  isOutside:    true
  description:  >
    A hole rises up out of the ground in front of you, its deep, dark mouth tall
    enough for one person and ominous enough for you to keep your distance.
    Occasionally you hear an echo rising from the cave.
  exits:
    west: forest_clearing

# todo: you are too scared to enter without a light.

henge_cliff:
  name:         cliff
  isOutside:    true
  description:  >
    You are at the edge of a majestic cliff, too rocky and windy to support
    the growth of trees, shrubs, or grass. You can't see the base, but
    it's probably a rocky shore. A dark, choppy ocean extends almost
    infinitely into the distance, but you can see a small peninsula far
    in the east, and a small island with tall trees out to the north.
