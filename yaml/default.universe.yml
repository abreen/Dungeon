# Default Dungeon universe file
# The following universe file is included with all installations of
# Dungeon. Feel free to experiment with it. The document format is YAML.
# This universe was written by Alexander Breen (alexander.breen@gmail.com).
# Your modification of it coincides with an acknowledgement that you will
# not hold me responsible if something terrible happens.

# Every Dungeon universe file consists of three YAML documents: the first is
# a preamble, containing settings for the entire universe. The second is the
# list of rooms in the universe. The third is the list of items.
# Each object in the universe has a unique string ID that you may choose here.

weather:    true        # Whether to generate weather in the universe
spawn:      henge       # The string ID of the room in which players start

--- # rooms

henge:
  name:         henge   # The name of the room, used when describing it
  isOutside:    true    # Whether to print weather (not yet implemented)

    You are in the center of a large henge, perhaps as wide as fifty meters in 
    diameter, with a circle of huge, rectangular, stone monoliths surrounding 
    it. The stones have the worn, rounded appearance of century-old building 
    material. From what you can see, the henge is perched atop a rocky 
    cliff, whose northern edge overlooks some water. To the south there is 
    a forest. The air is surprisingly still inside the henge.

forest_edge:
  name:         forest edge
  isOutside:    true
  description:  >
    The cliff slopes into a smooth hill, covered with healthy grasses. A few 
    meters in front of you there stands a tree with a giant, dark trunk. 
    The lowest branches of the tree are moving slightly in the wind, almost 
    as if the tree were taking breaths. Hundreds (thousands?) of trees span 
    your vision to the south.
  exits:
    north: henge


henge_cliff:
  name:         cliff
  isOutside:    true
  description:  >
    You are at the edge of a majestic cliff, too rocky and windy to support 
    the growth of trees, shrubs, or grass. You can't see the base, but 
    it's probably a rocky shore. A dark, choppy ocean extends almost
    infinitely into the distance, but you can see a small peninsula far
    in the east, and a small island with tall trees out to the north.
